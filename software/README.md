# Software Components

Mission-critical code for both the onboard computer and ground station lives here. This includes all ros nodes, functional interfaces, and custom project-specific files.

- `onboard/`: ROS nodes, control loops, and sensor interfaces that run on the vehicle.
- `ground_station/`: Operator HMI, telemetry, logging, and video aggregation.
<!-- - `common/`: Shared proto/ROS message definitions, libraries, and utilities. -->
