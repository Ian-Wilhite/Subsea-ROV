# Documentation

This project serves as the senior capstone project for the engineering students developing it, and therefore the design process was strictly tracked. Deliverables presented were either presented to (1) Dr. Andrew Conkey and Dr. Homero Murzi for the ITDE 401/402 coursework, or (2) the sponsor representatives from the Subsea Engineering program, Prof. Ron Ledbetter and Prof. Don Wells.

- `design/`: Control basis derivations for thruster configurations to determine gimbal effectiveness. Optimal thruster placement setup and results. 
- `deliverables/`: These documents were delviered for completion of an engineering capstone project, and include the Quality Functional Diagram (QFD), Team Charter, and Bill of Materials (BOM).

<!-- 
- `templates/`: templates for other documentation.
- `guides/`: need user manual?
