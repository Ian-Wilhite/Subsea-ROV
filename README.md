# A&M Subsea ROV Capstone '26

This is the repository for the Subsea Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) Interdisiplinary Engineering Capstone project sponsored by the Subsea Engineering Program at Texas A&M.

We would like to thank:
 - Professor Ron Ledbetter and Professor Don Wells with the Texas A&M Subsea Engineering Program for their project sponsorship and continued guidance.
 - Texas A&M Department of Multidisciplinary Engineering and the capstone professors, Dr. Andrew Conkey and Dr. Homero Murzi.
 - Texas A&M College of Engineering for the university resources for testing including the Fisher Eningeering Design Center (FEDC)

This repository gathers every artifact that supports the Subsea Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) interdisciplinary engineering capstone: software, hardware, documentation, and analysis.
